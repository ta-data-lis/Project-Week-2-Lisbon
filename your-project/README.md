## Project Description
This project intends to analyse the mobility in Lisbon Metro Area (AML), using the statistics from INE's survey on mobility of 2017. 
Since all of the group members are fom AML and two of them commute by bike, the goal was to understand which of the transports is the most efficient.

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions
The main question was "What is the most efficient means of transport for commuting?"

After the initial analysis of the data available other two hypothesis arose:
1. The number of layovers influences the commute duration
2. The distance and duration of the commute where positively correlated.

## Dataset
The data used was retrieved from the Portuguese Statistics Institute (INE). All the datasets used were already information treated statistically and it was not possible to use the raw data. 
We used three datasets: one containing the duration of commute per motive and transport, other containing the distance of commute per motive and transport, and the number of layovers per transport.

## Workflow

1. Research and data collection
We started by deciding on the subject and search for availabe data, collecting the most relevant. After this we questioned what did we wanted to know and what could be answered by the information availabe.
2. Data cleaning and database creation
After identifying the most relevant data we proceded to the creation of a data base in MySQL importing the availave csv. The data was cleanned using pandas in Jupyter Notebook. 
3. Data calculations
Using pandas DataFrames we proceded to the calculatons needed to answer the questions and to confirm the hypothesis proposed. 
4. Insights and conclusions
